### Introduction
The library is an implementation of the algorithm described in [[4]](#paper4). The algorithm was first proposed in [[1]](#paper1).

### How to get
Type the following command into your shell:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jdiemke/delaunay-triangulator.git
```
This will create a copy of the repository in your current working directory.
### How to use
Maven Dependency:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.jdiemke.delaunay-triangulator</groupId>
    <artifactId>DelaunayTriangulator</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
Gradle Dependency:
```
compile group: 'com.github.jdiemke.delaunay-triangulator', name: 'DelaunayTriangulator', version: '1.0.0'
```
The code below shows how to use the `DelaunayTriangulator` class in order to triangulate a given set of points:
```java
try {
    Vector<Vector2D> pointSet = loadPointSet("data/normal-formation.conf");
    
    delaunayTriangulator = new DelaunayTriangulator(pointSet);
    delaunayTriangulator.triangulate();
    
    Vector<Triangle2D> triangleSoup = delaunayTriangulator.getTriangles();
    
} catch (NotEnoughPointsException e) {
}
```
The constructor throws a `NotEnoughPointsException` if it is invoked with less than three points.
### How to build
The Delaunay triangulator library uses Gradle as a build tool and makes use of its multi project build capabilities. Each subproject contains its own build file and can be build separately. Hence, you can build only the part you want. For example, if you just want to build the library, then it is sufficient to locate into the project's root directory and type the following command into your shell:
```bash
gradle library:build
```
This will cause Gradle to build the `DelaunayTriangulator-1.0.3.jar` library artifact in `library/build/libs/`. If you just want to build the example, then type the following into your shell:
```bash
gradle example:build
```
This causes Gradle to build the `example.zip` and `example.tar` distribution artifacts in `example/build/distributions/`. In case you want to build the whole multi project, then type:
```bash
gradle build
```
### API Documentation
The Delaunay triangulator API documentation can be found [here](http://jdiemke.github.io/delaunay-triangulator/javadoc). You can also build it yourself using the javadoc Gradle task by typing the following into your shell:
```bash
gradle library:javadoc
```
This causes Gradle to build the javadoc API documentation artifacts in `library/build/docs/javadoc`.
### Dependencies
The Delaunay triangulation library itself does not have any dependencies; however, the example subproject uses JOGL 2.3.2 for rendering a triangulated point set using OpenGL. See [http://jogamp.org/](http://jogamp.org/) for further details on JOGL.
### Demo Application
The screenshot below shows the demo application from the example project. In order to create a Delaunay triangulation you have to add points to the canvas by pressing the left mouse button. You need at least 3 points for the triangulation to be created.

### License
The Delaunay triangulation library is protected by the very permissive MIT license. This means you can do anything you want with the code with some minor restrictions related to attribution and liability (see the license below for more details). Nevertheless, it is prefered, but not necessary, that you share your enhancements concerning the project's source code.

### History
##### 2016-05-25 / Release 1.0.5
-   Added Travis CI build status badge support
-   Added Coveralls coverage status badge support

##### 2016-05-16 / Release 1.0.4
-   Added JUnit
-   Added a reference section to the README

##### 2016-05-05 / Release 1.0.3
-   Adjusted dependencies from JOGL 2.3.1 to JOGL 2.3.2
